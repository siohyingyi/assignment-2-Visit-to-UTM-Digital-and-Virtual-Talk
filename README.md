The activities “Virtual talk on UTMDigital” and visiting UTM digital are really benefit to me because I am able to figure out more detail about their future job. 
Throughout these activities, especially visiting to UTMDigital I get to experience more about how it feels like working as an ICT Officer and I get to know more about the job scope as an ICT Officer.
By participating in the virtual talk from UTM digital and taking a visit to the UTM digital, I have known that UTM digital is a place which equipped with well ICT equipment. 
At UTM digital, we have the chance to lodge a complaint, make a question and apply to solve our general ICT issue such as having a problem with the university WiFi, network and software. 
This is definitely useful for the students and staffs who are using the UTM ICT facilities. 
Throughout the visit to UTM digital,I get chance to visit their open office, digital care unit, data center and TM room. 
The open office is a place where the staffs do their work in an open space. The UTM digital care unit a unit who help the students to slove peoblems related to ICT. 
For example, problems related to student UTM ID, myUTM Protal website,
UTM smart application and UTM wifi. The data centre is important to support the software applications of the university.
The TM center is a place where the staff can have a meeting. TM Center provide Huawei IdeaHub which really contribute a lot in the staffs' job and discussion. 
These activities did excite me and may foster my interest about ICT. This is because these activities allow students to learn new knowledge apart from the slides and information from the text books.
I also met the friendly UTM digital staffs (Mr Zahari) who introduce the facilities and functions of UTM digital to us willingly.

In conclusion, I am grateful for the insights gained after visiting UTMDigital, I believe that the knowledge that I had gained will significantly contribute to my academic and also my future journey on ICT world. 
By now, I will start to work hard and improve myself because I am inspired to continue exploring and growing in ICT field.
